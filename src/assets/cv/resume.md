# SUMMARY

I am a hands-on product management and growth executive with 14+ years of experience in B2C & B2B tech organizations, ranging from seed-stage startups to post-IPO companies. In the past, I worked on renewable energy, ran a profitable agency & co-founded a startup. Occasionally, I build tiny products, write, and mentor. I always try to cultivate a beginner’s mind with a focus on lifelong learning.

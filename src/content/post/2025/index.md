Hello from Ubud, Bali!

Sporadically, I write annual reviews and reflect on my highlights, lowlights and lessons. You can check what happened [last year](/posts/2024/).

## TL;DR

2025 was my year of uncertainty

I've kept traveling with my wife, tried to keep my life in balance, quit my job[LINK], thought of going on sabbatical but gave into my curiosity and started a project.

It was a strange year, mostly because both halves seemed to feel like absolutely 2 different seasons of life. In-between working a job and moving around a lot to doubling down on my own definition of good work.

## Timeline

We've continued traveling with my wife, meeting family and friends in different countries, exploring nature and cities and creating new core experiences. Here are a few that stood out.

### Thailand

Exploring Koh Surin, Khao Lak, Phuket and spending some time in Bang Tao beach.

## Highlights

- The biggest decision this year was to [quit my job](/posts/stuff-i-learned-at-delivery-hero/). It wasn't easy considering I felt valued, had wonderful colleagues and overall there were more benefits than downsides, but I was closing in on burnout again.
- After a week of doing nothing, my hands started itching and I obviously wanted to see how far I can push the LLMs to build something meaningful, something close to my heart. So I got my Claude Code Max subscription from Anthropic, fired up Sonnet 3.7 at at a time and started on. What started as an experiment to learn how to develop with language models and see how I can use it as a PM became [Keepsake](www.makekeepsake.com)
- I've tried to keep in touch with people mindfully this year. It is super hard to maintain relationships as adults but I am very grateful to have a core group of people from various corners of the world that help me keep my sanity.
- My marriage hit 2 years and 1 year since our wedding ceremony. Looking back at all the pictures and videos brought a lot of memories and tears seeing everyone we love in one place. We've also developed as individuals and kept each other in check with honesty and hard work on our triggers.
- I hit the gym 180 times this year. Mediated at least 80 days and also restarted playing tennis in Bali, which I played as a kid and regret not taking seriously. Eating clean was quite easy and I always tried to maintain a high protein diet, taking main supplements (omega, creatine and magnesium). Also managed to improve my sleep with earplugs which are honestly such a great and worthy hack. Overall my stress level decreased significantly but I still struggle with anxiety (more on that in lowlights).

## Lowlights

- My second half of the year turned into auto-pilot which I was so adamant at avoiding. I hit 16 hour days of working with breaks for food and gym and was able to sustain the pace for around 4 months. Then I started having a minor anxiety attacks and bursts of being completely apathetic towards doing anything. Despit being the flow and building it feels like I am both in a present moment and completely oblivious to everything else outside of it. There is something addictive about assisted coding.
- I didn't plan to substitute my income and was going to live off savings. It never felt scary as my taste is not exactly expensive and I've done the sabbath a few times in my life already. I knew I wanted to take a break to focus on myself, journaling, writing, exploring hobbies that I long forgotten. So most of the year, I lived from my savings
- Uncertainty

| Spirituality  | 3/5   | Mediated inconsistently, without deepening the practice |

## Consumption

Various work, storytelling, art and creativity that I enjoyed this year.

- [Not fade away by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137554.Not_Fade_Away) - I didn't read much this year, but as of a few years I started having a lot of nostalgia and appreciation for books about living life well. Not fade away is a story of Peter Barton, a man who tried to live his life to the fullest whilst fighting for his life and trying to understand what really matters.
  ![Excerpt from book Not Fade Away by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton](./attachments/not-fade-away.png)

- **[Ultraspeaking](https://ultraspeaking.com/)** - It was a bit of a mixed bag for me as I heard raving reviews online and had high expectations. I only participated in `fundamentals` and felt like a lot of learning is outsourced to the async games part with break-out rooms. I would still recommend it

- Andor was my favourite piece of fiction this year by a large margin. [This manifesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-asb8zTiuZ4) is just briliant and one of the best monologues in my opinion. Sinners came close and was a fun watch, but Andor seems like one of those rare masterpieces that do not come out often these days.

### Game

I am not much of a gamer these days but with all the rumours about Half-Life 3 coming out together with steam machine I replayed Half-Life 2 and it still holds up really well. Which got me back into classics that I've never played before like Bioshock.

### Music

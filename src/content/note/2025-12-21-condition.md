There is just one condition that ensures unconditional love: that there is no game to be played. There is nothing you want from the other, and there is nothing they want from you. All that matters is mutual presence, and we already know what this feels like in the context of our closest bonds. The key is to take this same dynamic and apply it to the greater world as well.

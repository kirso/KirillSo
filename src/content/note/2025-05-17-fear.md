> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

The litany encourages facing fear, allowing it to pass over and through oneself, and then using the inner eye to observe its path. This process aims to break free from the destructive power of fear and regain control.

      <div class="max-w-2xl space-y-4 text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          I've spent the last decade building products at startups and scale-ups across three continents. Most of that time was spent figuring out what users actually need versus what they say they want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in the USSR, raised in the Czech Republic, I've since called Germany, the UK, the US, Australia, and Singapore home. Each place taught me something different about how people live and work.

        Why do some products feel inevitable while others feel forced? Why do some teams build magic while others build meetings? These questions keep me curious.

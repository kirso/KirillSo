## Currently

I'm on **sabbatical** after leaving my role as Principal Product Manager at Delivery Hero. Taking time to reset, explore, and figure out what's next.

## Traveling

Currently traveling through Southeast Asia with my wife [Sarah](https://www.sarahkhanamajid.com/). No fixed plans - just going where curiosity takes us.

## Building

- Experimenting with AI tools and building small projects
- Writing more consistently on this blog
- Learning new things about web development

## Reading

Working through a mix of books on technology, philosophy, and business. Trying to read more broadly than I did when working full-time.

## Health

- Weightlifting 3-4x per week
- Playing tennis when possible
- Walking a lot (best way to explore new places)
